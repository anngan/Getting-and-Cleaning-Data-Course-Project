# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Course-Project
*Peer-graded Assignment*

## Description
The purpose of this project is to demonstrate your ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis. You will be graded by your peers on a series of yes/no questions related to the project. 
One of the most exciting areas in all of data science right now is wearable computing - see for example this article . Companies like Fitbit, Nike, and Jawbone Up are racing to develop the most advanced algorithms to attract new users. The data linked to from the course website represent data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone. A full description is available at the site where the data was obtained (see links below for the site and the data used in this project).

## Code
The code used in this assignment should do the following:
[x] **Merge** the training and the test sets to create one data set.
[x] **Extract** only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
[x] **Use** descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
[x] Appropriately **label** the data set with descriptive variable names.
[x] From the data set in step 4, **create** a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

## This repository contains:
1. **README.md** file: this file which contains information about the assignment as well as describes the parts that
    are required to complete the assignment.
2. **run_analysis.R** script which is the code for tidying the data set that describes all the steps of organizing it.
3. **CodeBook.md** which is the description of used variables.
